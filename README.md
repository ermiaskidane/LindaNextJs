Google authentication might show you an `app has been block` so we as developer has to verify the app so as to utilize by any client who want to access our app. The verification is a bit long process through emailing back and forth with google authenticater. we can refer thier docs here: [verification-steps](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/7454865#security-checkup) read over the part of [Upcoming-Policy-Enforcement-Notice]

## to get quick access

to get fast access and bypass the verification

- [Test-Users](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project=lama-resturant) make sure you add all the users you want them to have acess OR
- [publishing-status](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project=lama-resturant) press the publish app button so the app would be in production, here unlike the above any users will create account

Those steps don't have full functionality as the verified app.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

<!-- ## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
